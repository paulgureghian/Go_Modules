Exploring Go Modules

Go's strive for simplicity has led to many features that have made Go programs easier to create and consume. This course will introduce you to Go's module system and show you how to use them to create and maintain applications and their dependencies.

Go modules improve upon the legacy workspace system by providing a simple method to create reproducible builds and clear rules around working with versioned dependencies. In this course, Exploring Go Modules, you’ll gain the ability to create and maintain module-based applications. First, you’ll explore what modules are and learn the primary workflows used with modules. Next, you’ll discover how to work with versioned dependencies. Finally, you’ll learn how to use some less common, but still very useful commands that can simplify the management of your projects. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of Go modules needed to use them in your next project as well as migrate your existing projects.
